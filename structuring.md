# Moloch V3 - Modular Molochs

Step 1: Come up with a wishlist 

Step 2: Define tighter requirements 

Step 3: Outline structure & create tasks

Step 4: Let's hack together 


## The Wishlist 
* Ability to handle ETH as tribute / a currency
* Ability to re-add Guild Kicked Members
* Ability for anyone to send tip / payment to DAO and reflect that in GuildBank
* Ability to sponsor a proposal immediately, but only allow for proposal submissions at a certain interval
* More modular roles
